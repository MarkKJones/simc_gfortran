Modified MAID code for calling from SIMC

get_xn_maid_07.f

subroutine get_xn_maid_07 called in event.f



******************
Wrote a short program call_maid.f

This calls subroutine  get_xn_maid_07 .
Just used to make comparison to MAID web site.

Original Code to run MAID07

run_maid_07.f  fortran code obtained for Tiator reproduces MAID website 
               main program is run_maid_07
	       call subroutine DFTOT with input
	       EIMEV = beam energy (MeV)
	       EFMEV = scattered electron energy
	       THE = scatttered electron angle (deg)
	       TH = scattered pi0 center of mass polar angle (deg)
	       PHI = scattered pi0 center of mass azimuthal angle (deg)
	       returns
	       S5FOLD = 5-fold center-of-mass cross section (ub/MeV/sr2)
	       reaction is set to p(e,e,pi0)p

maid07_final.dat used in subroutine SOLUTIONS

piN_2500.dat  used in subroutine MAID and SPLINES

COmpile:
gfortran run_maid_07.f -o run_maid_07
